The Menin Road
---
Nash received the commission for this work, which was orginally to have been called 'A Flanders
Battlefield', from the Ministry of Information in April 1918. It was to feature in a Hall of
Remembrance devoted to "fighting subjects, home subjects and the war at sea and in the air".

Pieter Bruegel the Elder
---
From a bird’s-eye view – the only way Bruegel could legibly fit in the impressive number of figures –
the viewer looks down onto a wide square with a transition from an urban to a rural setting at the
edges. On the right the view opens on to a long street laid out in central perspective and leading
to the city centre, where a church steeple (or town-hall tower) soars into the sky.

Landscape with an Aqueduct
---
Théodore Géricault
---
his work is one of a projected set of four monumental landscapes representing the times of day that
Gericault painted in his Paris studio. (Only three were completed.) Conceived as a decorative
ensemble, the paintings fuse souvenirs of ruins in the Italian countryside, which the artist had
visited in 1816 and 1817, with the grand manner exemplified by past masters Nicolas Poussin and
Joseph Vernet.

The Adoration of the Shepherds
---
Giorgione
---
Giorgione portrayed the main scene on the right, in front of a dark grotto, while on the left is
bright landscape crowned by trees. A sincere dramatic tension is obtained by the choice to place the
kneeling shepherd pilgrims in the centre of the painting. The entire group of parents, child, and pilgrim form an anchored rectangle that forms a counterpoised focal point to the receding landscape on the left.
