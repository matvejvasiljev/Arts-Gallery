                <h4>Paul Nash</h4>
                <p>Nash received the commission for this work, which was orginally to have been called 'A Flanders
                    Battlefield', from the Ministry of Information in April 1918. It was to feature in a Hall of
                    Remembrance devoted to ‘fighting subjects, home subjects and the war at sea and in the air’.</p>

                <h2>Children’s Games</h2>
                <h4>Pieter Bruegel the Elder</h4>
                <p>From a bird’s-eye view – the only way Bruegel could legibly fit in the impressive number of figures –
                    the viewer looks down onto a wide square with a transition from an urban to a rural setting at the
                    edges. On the right the view opens on to a long street laid out in central perspective and leading
                    to the city centre, where a church steeple (or town-hall tower) soars into the sky.</p>

                <h2>Landscape with an Aqueduct</h2>
                <h4>Théodore Géricault</h4>
                <p>This work is one of a projected set of four monumental landscapes representing the times of day that
                    Gericault painted in his Paris studio. (Only three were completed.) Conceived as a decorative
                    ensemble, the paintings fuse souvenirs of ruins in the Italian countryside, which the artist had
                    visited in 1816 and 1817, with the grand manner exemplified by past masters Nicolas Poussin and
                    Joseph Vernet.</p>

                <h2>The Adoration of the Shepherds</h2>
                <h4>Giorgione</h4>
                <p>Giorgione portrayed the main scene on the right, in front of a dark grotto, while on the left is
                    bright landscape crowned by trees. A sincere dramatic tension is obtained by the choice to place the
                    kneeling shepherd pilgrims in the centre of the painting. The entire group of parents, child, and
                    pilgrim form an anchored rectangle that forms a counterpoised focal point to the receding landscape
                    on the left. </p>
